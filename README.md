# Unity Game Development Tutorials by Pneuma

## Project Description
This repository contains a 2D Unity project compiling the tutorial scripts for 12 distinct Unity mechanics, including:

- Item pickup and collection
- Respawning and checkpoints
- Simple enemy programming
- Sound effects integration
- Health system implementation
- Particle effects
- Animation basics
- Player knockback
- Combat system mechanics
- Shooting mechanics
- Collision detection
- Player movement

The project serves as an organized reference for learning and experimenting with fundamental Unity mechanics in a practical, hands-on manner.

## Motivation
During my initial Unity learning attempts, I struggled to fully grasp essential concepts and needed three separate tries before a game jam forced me to truly understand them. Most online tutorials I found were either too complex or skipped fundamental details.  
I created these tutorials both to consolidate my own understanding and to provide clear, beginner-friendly guidance for others, complementing the video tutorials I produced on my YouTube channel: [Pneuma Studios](https://www.youtube.com/@Pneuma-Studios).

## Project Context / Scope
This project originated as a self-study initiative, driven by a personal interest in Unity and content creation.  
It represents the convergence of software development learning with creative expression, reflecting my long-standing engagement in digital content creation since childhood.

## Lessons Learned
- Consolidating multiple tutorials into one project improved my understanding of how Unity components interact.
- Simplifying complex mechanics into minimal, reproducible examples was essential for deep learning.
- This project reinforced the value of documenting processes and design decisions for both personal reflection and educational purposes.

## Installation & Usage
1. Install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) and a compatible Unity Editor version.
2. Open this project folder via Unity Hub.
3. Explore or modify individual tutorial scenes to study specific mechanics.

## Future / Possible Extensions
Potential future work includes creating AI-focused Unity tutorials, emphasizing simulation and experimental applications rather than traditional game development mechanics.
